## 📌 Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 5 – Build the Future of AI Computer Control with Screenpipe - Terminator**

---

## 🎯 Objective

Installing applications and executing system-level actions often require manual effort, technical know-how, and time. For non-technical users or busy professionals, this process can be inefficient, confusing, or error-prone.

**Real-world Use Case:**
> "Install VS Code and set it up for Python development."
>
> "Run the server and check logs."

**Who it serves:** Everyday users, developers, and IT professionals looking for a smarter, easier way to interact with their systems.

**Value:**
- Saves time and effort with AI-powered automation
- Bridges the gap for non-technical users
- Streamlines repetitive tasks for developers
- Creates a natural, assistant-like experience
