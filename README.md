📌 Problem Statement

Problem Statement 5 – Build the Future of AI Computer Control with Screenpipe - Terminator

🎯 Objective

Installing applications and executing system-level actions often require manual effort, technical know-how, and time. For non-technical users or busy professionals, this process can be inefficient, confusing, or error-prone.

Real-world Use Case:

"Install VS Code and set it up for Python development."

"Run the server and check logs."

Who it serves: Everyday users, developers, and IT professionals looking for a smarter, easier way to interact with their systems.

Value:

Saves time and effort with AI-powered automation

Bridges the gap for non-technical users

Streamlines repetitive tasks for developers

Creates a natural, assistant-like experience
